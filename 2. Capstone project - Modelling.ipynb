    "We take multiple approaches to predict the variant played on a given board.  \n",
    "The **trade-off between accuracy and computational capacities** plays an important role in the analysis. We are working on a sample of 9000 observations and might already face some computational complexity issues, which could grow exponentially when using more samples. While **maximising the accuracy is the main objective** of the project, we will keep an eye on the **complexity** of the models. Therefore, we record the **computation time as a proxy of the computational complexity** of a given model.  \n",
    "More precisely, we record the accuracy on the testing set, the tuning time using grid-search cross-validation, the training time for each of the evaluated models as well as the recall, precision and F1 scores for the blitz variant (as is the most \"important\" and played variant, we give a particular attention to it) and on average.    \n",

    "In the Jupyter notebook \"2.2 Capstone project - PCA.ipynb\", we use a PCA on the full dataset and run the usual procedure. The results are commented, as well as the rational for choosing the PCA.  \n",
    "In the Jupyter notebook \"2.3.0 Capstone project - Nested models.ipynb\" and its copies, we use a nested strategy, using a 2-step process. The results are commented in the \"2.4.0 Capstone project - Nested models.ipynb\" and only shown on its copies.  \n",

Indeed, atomic, blitz, chess960, crazyhouse and racingKings show similar probabilities and others splits are needed.
